# Gif Grabber

When I was working at pacmags, a fellow sysadmin would send around his selection of gifs for the morning. Our team was allowed to conduct work as we needed, and the hours we worked would often be varying so we allowed ourselves to start slow in the mornings, eating breakfast, drinking coffee and reading the news. That sort of thing. 

One day the gif master Kurt was on annual leave. We didn't see it coming because he never really told us when he was taking annual leave, where he was going etc. so when we found out he was on annual leave, we assumed he would be completely disconnected from the internet and thusly, wouldn't deliver the giffy goodness. Someone had to step up. Someone had to take control. That someone was me.

As you all know, if I can be lazy then I'll do it with style. I wrote a script to handle the mundane task for sourcing gifs. From there I could hand-pick my preferred giffy goodness. 

It does - unfortunately - rely on other sites which sucks. But let's hope they never go down.
